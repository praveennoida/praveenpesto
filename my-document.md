Q.No 1-Protocol stacks are a layered collection of protocols that work together to provide communication services. Each protocol in the stack is responsible for a specific task, and by layering them, we can create a more robust and reliable system.
A web service implementation depends on technologies often organized in a layered stack. The implementation itself defines a standard protocol for each technology layer, with each layer depending on the layers appearing below it in the stack.
Beginning at the bottom of the stack, the Transport layer defines the technology standards for communication, allowing information to move across the network. HTTP or HTTPS are often used as the standard for the transport layer.

Q.no-2  (a)	Apache HTTP Server
This is the most popular web server in the world developed by the Apache Software Foundation. Apache web server is an open source software and can be installed on almost all operating systems including Linux, Unix, Windows, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and more. About 60% of the web server machines run the Apache Web Server.
(b) Internet Information Services
The Internet Information Server (IIS) is a high performance Web Server from Microsoft. This web server runs on Windows NT/2000 and 2003 platforms ( and may be on upcoming new Windows version also). IIS comes bundled with Windows NT/2000 and 2003; Because IIS is tightly integrated with the operating system so it is relatively easy to administer it.
 (c) Lighttpd
The lighttpd, pronounced lighty is also a free web server that is distributed with the FreeBSD operating system. This open source web server is fast, secure and consumes 
much less CPU power. Lighttpd can also run on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris operating systems.
 (d) Sun Java System Web Server
This web server from Sun Microsystems is suited for medium and large websites. Though the server is free it is not open source. It however, runs on Windows, Linux and Unix platforms. The Sun Java System web server supports various languages, scripts and technologies required for Web 2.0 such as JSP, Java Servlets, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby on Rails, ASP and Coldfusion etc.

Q.NO -3 	Web Hosting is a service that allows hosting/post-web-server applications( website or web page ) on a computer system through which web-browser clients can have easy access to electronic content on the Internet.
Different types of hosting services
1.	Free Hosting:
This is a free non-paid web hosting service. This type of hosting is available with many prominent sites that offer to host some web pages for no cost, like Hostinger.
2.	Shared/Virtual Hosting:
It’s a web hosting service where many websites reside on one web server connected to the internet. This type of hosting is provided under one’s own domain name, www.yourname.com. 
3.	Dedicated Hosting:
Hosted on a dedicated server, this type of hosting is best suited for large websites with high traffic. In this, the company wishing to go online rents an entire web server from a hosting company.

Q.NO-4 Application scalability refers to the capacity of an app to handle growth, especially in handling more users and evolving concurrently with your business needs. Specifically, scalability relates to the app’s backend and database and the servers they are hosted on.
The benefit is that you can safely add more features to scalable applications without worrying about impacts on the app’s performance. The fundamental goal of any app is to provide consistently high functionality and performance levels, whether you have 10 users or 10 million.
(a) Vertical scaling- Horizontal scaling, often known as “scaling out,” is the process of increasing the number of nodes and machines in the resource pool. For a sequential piece of logic to be processed in parallel across numerous devices, horizontal scaling calls for breaking it into smaller chunks and delegating the logic to the new machine. In simpler terms, scaling horizontally is about hiring new employees for an additional client/problem set. 
(b) Horizontal scaling-  Vertical scaling, often known as “scaling up,” is the process of increasing the power of an existing system, such as the CPU or RAM, to meet the rising demands. Because there is no need to alter the logic, vertical scaling is simpler. Instead, you are only executing the same code on machines with more capacity.

Q.NO-5 	Search engine optimization (SEO) is the art and science of getting pages to rank higher in search engines such as Google. Because search is one of the main ways in which people discover content online, ranking higher in search engines can lead to an increase in traffic to a website.
Search engine optimization done properly can have the potential to dramatically increase the amount of traffic that a website receives, but all of that search traffic won’t help grow a business unless it converts into paying customers. This is where conversion rate optimization (CRO) comes in.
Conversion rate optimization involves using methods such as A/B testing to make changes to websites and measure the impact they have on a site’s conversion rate. Successful search marketers know that just getting traffic to a site is not enough, what the traffic does once it arrives on the site is just as important.
